\begin{abstract}
Extreme Value theory deals with the observation of extreme events which are the maxima of a sequence of observations and admits that these events occur at regular intervals in time. Recently a new theory called Continuous Time Random Maxima gets much regard which can be thought of as a generalized extreme value theory. Instead of looking at events at fixed, regular time-points, this theory assumes random waiting times between the observations. This theory provides a model for bursty events, where the waiting times between the observations are heavy tailed.\\

% This is where the abstract is placed. It should include a statement about the problem being addressed in the presentation (and paper, if submitted). Continue with a discussion of why it is important to address this problem. This may be followed by some summary information about the models and methods developed and/or used to address the problem. Conclude with a description of the key results and contributions that will be covered in the presentation (and paper).

\section{Introduction}
Extreme Value theory deals with the observation of extreme events which are the maxima of a sequence of observations and admits that these events occur at regular intervals in time. Recently a new theory called Continuous Time Random Maxima gets much regard, which can be thought of as a generalized extreme value theory. Instead of looking at events at fixed, regular time-points, this theory assumes random waiting times between the observations.


\section{CTRMs and their scaling limits}

\subsection{Notation}

Let $c > 0$ be a scaling parameter (which may be ignored until the next section). 
Let $(J^{(c)},W^{(c)}),(J^{(c)}_1,W^{(c)}_1),(J^{(c)}_2,W^{(c)}_2), \ldots$ 
be i.i.d.\ bivariate random vectors on $\mathbb R \times [0, \infty)$. 
The components $J^{(c)}$ and $W^{(c)}$ represent an event magnitude and 
a waiting time, respectively. 
We first set up some notation: 


\begin{definition}
Write 
\begin{align}
S^{(c)}(n) &= \sum_{i=1}^n W^{(c)}_i, 
&
M^{(c)}(n) &= \bigvee_{i=1}^n J^{(c)}_i
\end{align} 
for the cumulative sum of the waiting times and the cumulative maximum of the 
magnitudes. 
The renewal process associated with $S^{(c)}$ is 
\begin{align} \label{eq:renewal-process}
N^{(c)}(t) = \max\{n \in \mathbb N: S^{(c)}(n) \le t\}.
\end{align}
Then the process
\begin{align}
V^{(c)}(t) 
= M^{(c)}\left( N^{(c)}(t) \right) 
= \bigvee_{k=1}^{N^{(c)}(t)} J^{(c)}_k, \quad t \ge 0.
\end{align}
is called a CTRM process (Continuous Time Random Maxima). Finally, the process
\begin{align}
\tilde V^{(c)}(t) 
= M^{(c)}\left( N^{(c)}(t) + 1 \right) 
= \bigvee_{k=1}^{N^{(c)}(t) + 1} J^{(c)}_k, \quad t \ge 0.
\end{align}
a OCTRM (Oracle Continuous Time Random Maxima).
\end{definition}

The conceptual difference between the CTRM and the OCTRM is that for the CTRM, 
the waiting time $W^{(c)}_k$ precedes the magnitude $J^{(c)}_k$, whereas for 
the OCTRM it succeeds it. In other words, for the CTRM we have 
$W^{(c)}_1, J^{(c)}_1, W^{(c)}_2, J^{(c)}_2, W^{(c)}_3, \ldots$ whereas for the
OCTRM, we have $J^{(c)}_1, W^{(c)}_1, J^{(c)}_2, W^{(c)}_2, J^{(c)}_3, \ldots$. 


\subsection{Limits of sum and maximum}

In this article, we study threshold crossing times and threshold events, which 
are stochastic processes derived from the underlying (O)CTRM process. In
particular, we establish scaling limit theorems, or invariance principles. As 
the scale $c \to \infty$ increases, $W^{(c)}$ and $J^{(c)}$ decrease as follows: 
\begin{align}
J^{(c)} &\stackrel{d}{=} \frac{J - d(c)}{a(c)}, 
& 
W^{(c)} &\stackrel{d}{=} \frac{W}{b(c)}
\end{align}
where $(J,W)$ is some random vector on $\mathbb R \times [0,\infty)$, 
where $a(c), b(c)$ and $d(c)$ are deterministic scaling functions, 
and where $\stackrel{d}{=}$ denotes equality in distribution. 

It is a well-known result from classical extreme value theory that 
if the distribution of $J$ is continuous, then there exist $a(c)$ and $d(c)$
such that 
$M^{(n)}(n)$ converges weakly to a generalized Extreme Value Distribution with shape parameter $\xi \in \mathbb R$, i.e.
\begin{align}
M^{(n)}(n) \stackrel{d}{\to} A,
\end{align}
where the distribution of $A$ is given by
\begin{align}
\PP(A \le z) = G(z) = \exp\left(-[1+\xi z]^{-1/\xi}\right). \label{Mises}
\end{align}
Equation \eqref{Mises} is the so-called van-Mises representation for Extreme Value distributions. For $\xi>0$ one gets a Fr\'echet distribution, for $\xi<0$ a Weibull and for $(1+\xi z)=e$ a Gumbel distribution. We write ${\rm GEV}(\xi, \mu, \sigma)$ for the probability 
distribution of the random variable $\sigma A + \mu$. 

The extremal limit theorem allows for an extension to a functional
limit: assume that the norming sequences $a(n)$ and $d(n)$ are as 
in Theorem~\ref{th:GP}. Then 
\begin{align*}
M^{(c)}(\lfloor ct \rfloor)
\stackrel{d}{\to} A(t),
\quad c \to \infty.
\end{align*}
Convergence is in Skorokhod's $J_1$ topology, and the limit
process $A(t)$ is an \emph{extremal process}, with
finite-dimensional distributions given by
\begin{align*}
\PP(A(t_i)\leq x_i,1\leq i \leq d) 
= F_A(\wedge_{i=1}^d x_i)^{t_1} 
F_A(\wedge_{i=2}^d x_i)^{t_2-t_1}
\ldots F_A(x_d)^{t_d-t_{d-1}},
\end{align*}
with $F_A(x)$ being a GEV distribution.

In this text, we assume that the waiting times $W^{(c)}_k$ have a tail
parameter $\beta \in (0,1)$, i.e. 
$\PP(W^{(c)} > t) \sim L(t) t^{-\beta}$ as $t \uparrow \infty$ 
for some slowly varying function $L(t)$.\footnote{
We write $f(t) \sim g(t)$ if their quotient converges to $1$.
}
The $W^{(c)}_k$ are then said to lie in the 
domain of attraction of a stable law, meaning that 
\begin{align}\label{eq:sclt}
S^{(n)}(n) \overset{d}{\longrightarrow} D, 
\quad n \to \infty
\end{align}
exists, for some regularly varying $b(c)$ at $\infty$ with parameter $1/\beta$;
we write $b(c) \in {\rm RV}_\infty(1/\beta)$.
The limit $D$ is then a positively skewed stable random variable, with
$\E[\exp(-sD)] = \exp(-s^\beta)$.
As for the maximum, the following functional limit theorem holds for the sum:
\begin{align}
S^{(c)}(\Floor{ct}) \overset{d}{\longrightarrow} D(t), 
\quad c \to \infty
\end{align}
with convergence in the Skorokhod $J_1$ topology.
The limit $D(t)$ is a stable subordinator, i.e.\ an increasing
L\'evy process with Laplace transform $\exp(-t s^\beta)$.\\ 
It is well known (see e.g.\ \cite{limitCTRW}) that the renewal
process then satisfies the functional limit
\begin{align}
N(ct)/\tilde b(c) \cd E(t) = \inf\{r: D(r) > t\}, 
\quad c \to \infty
\end{align}
for a scaling function $\tilde b(c)$ which is 
asymptotically inverse to $b(c)$, in the sense
of \cite[p.20]{seneta}: 
\begin{align}\label{eq:tildeb}
b(\tilde b(c)) \sim c \sim \tilde b(b(c)).
\end{align}
Note that $\tilde b \in {\rm RV}_\infty(\beta)$ 
\cite{limitCTRW}.
The limit process $E(t)$ is called the \emph{inverse} stable
subordinator \cite{invSubord}.
Was hier noch alles rein muss:
\begin{itemize} 
\item extreme value distribution
\item convergence of M(n)
\item Überleiten zu CTRM, via heavy-tailed waiting times, etc.
\item $J_1$ convergence definition
\item $J_1$ convergence of M(nt)
\item defintion of extremal processes 
\end{itemize}

\begin{proposition}
The CTRM and OCTRM processes are Semi-Markov processes: 
Let $\mathcal R = \{0\} \cup \{\sum_{k=1}^n W_k, n \in \mathbb N\}$ denote the set of renewal times, and let 
\begin{align*}
Z(t) = t - \sup((-\infty, t] \cap \mathcal R)
\end{align*}
be the \emph{age}, i.e.\ the time passed since the last renewal. Then the bivariate processes 
\begin{align*}
(V(t), Z(t)), \quad (\tilde V(t), Z(t)), \quad t \ge 0,
\end{align*}
are Markov processes with respect to their natural filtrations $\mathcal F_t = \sigma(V(s): s \le t)$ and $\tilde{\mathcal F}_t = \sigma(\tilde V(s): s \le t)$. 
\end{proposition}

The proof is deferred to Section \ref{sec:records}.

In XX it was shown that the CTRM $V(t) = M(N(t)$ and the OCTRM $\tilde V(t)$ have the following functional scaling limit in the Skorokhod $J_1$ topology: 
\begin{align*}
[V(ct) - d(\tilde b(c))] / a(\tilde b(c)) \stackrel{d}{\to} 
A(E(t)), \quad c \to \infty.
\end{align*}
Hence its scaling limit results from the time-change .....
We set $M(0) = x_L$, and $\max\{\} = 0$. 



\section{Scaling limits of threshold event time and magnitude}

\begin{definition}
The \textbf{threshold event} and the \textbf{threshold crossing time} 
of level $\ell$ are defined by
\begin{align*}
T^{(c)}(\ell) &= \inf\{t: V^{(c)}(t) > \ell\}, 
&
Y^{(c)}(\ell) &= V^{(c)}(T^{(c)}(\ell)).
\end{align*}
\end{definition}

In the following proposition we list some results about the relationship between the exceedances and their exceedance times.

\begin{proposition}\label{lem:independence}
Let $(V_t)_{t \geq 0}$ resp. $(\tilde{V}_t)_{t \geq 0}$ be a (coupled) CTRM resp. OCTRM process, and let $\ell \in [x_L,x_R]$.
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(i)]
The sequence of pairs $(Y^{(c)}_{\ell, k}, T^{(c)}_{\ell, k})_{k \in \mathbb N}$ 
is i.i.d.
\item[(ii)]
In the OCTRM case, the threshold event magnitude $Y_{\ell, k}$ and the 
corresponding exceedance time $T_{\ell, k}$ are independent for each $k \in \mathbb N$. 
\item[(iii)]
In the CTRM case, the exceedance and exceedance time are not necessarily independent. 
\end{enumerate}
\end{proposition}\begin{proof}
To write down!!
\end{proof}
The main purpose of this section is, to get the asymptotic distribution of the exceedance and the exceedance time as well as scaling limit theorems for their corresponding processes. It is well-known, that the excess function of $J$ is asymptotically Generalised Pareto distributed, i.e.
\begin{align*}
\PP(J_1 - \ell > y | J_1 > \ell) 
\approx (1+ \xi y / \tilde \sigma)^{-1/\xi} \rightarrow 1 - H(y) \text{ as } \ell \uparrow x_R,
\end{align*}
where $\tilde \sigma :=\sigma + \xi(\ell-\mu)$, $y>0$ and $1+\xi y/\tilde \sigma >0$. A distribution with CDF $H(y)$ is said to be from the \textbf{Generalised Pareto family}
$GP(\xi,\bar \sigma)$.\\  

\begin{theorem}(Verteilungskonvergenz der exceedance time)
For fixed $l>0$
\begin{align}
b(c) T(cl) \Rightarrow H(l) \text{ as } c \rightarrow \infty
\end{align} 
Where the CDF of $H(l)$ is given by
\begin{align*}
XX
\end{align*}
\end{theorem}

We can even show that the exceedance time process $(T_l)_{l \in \N}$ in converges to the inverse of CTRM resp. OCTRM limit in the $M_1$-topology.


\begin{theorem}(M1 convergence of the exceedance)
We have 
\begin{align*}
(T(cl))_{l \in [x_L,x_R]}  \rightarrow (D(A^{-1}(l)))_{l \in [x_L,x_R]} 
\end{align*}
\end{theorem}
Since the inverse function on XX is not continuous in Skorokhod's $J_1$ topology, we only get the convergence in the $M_1$ topology.\\
In XX and before in XX without noting it, it was shown, that in the uncoupled case the exceedance time is asymptomatically Mittag-Leffler distributed. This surprisingly holds in the coupled case as well. For$\beta \in (0,1)$, a standard Mittag-Leffler 
random variable $Y$ is positive with Laplace transform
$\E[\exp(-s Y)] = 1/(1+s^\beta)$. For $\sigma > 0$, we then write 
${\rm ML}(\beta, \sigma)$ for the distribution of $\sigma Y$. \\


\begin{theorem}(Asymptotic distribution of the exceedance (magnitudes))
We have 
\begin{align*}
(X(cl))_{l \in (0,1)} \rightarrow (A(A^{-1}(l)))_{l \in (0,1)} - l
\end{align*}
\end{theorem}

To proof this, we will first proof the following lemma.

\begin{lemma} 
Assume $(x_n)_{n \in \N} \subset \D$ and we have
\begin{align*}
x_n \rightarrow x  \text{ and }  x_n^{-1} \rightarrow x^{-1}. 
\end{align*}
Then it follows, that
\begin{align*}
x_n \circ x_n^{-1} \rightarrow x \circ x^{-1}.
\end{align*}
\end{lemma}


\section{Joint distribution of threshold event and threshold crossing time}

Define the potential measure, or expected occupation time, of the bivariate 
Markov process $(A(u),D(u))$:

\begin{align*}
U(B) = \ex \left[ \int_0^\infty \mathbf 1\{ (A_u, D_u) \in B\}\,du \right]
\end{align*}

Define the bivariate tail function $\overline \nu(x,t)$ via 

\begin{align}
\overline \nu(x,t) = \lim_{c \to \infty} c \pr [J^{(c)} > x, W^{(c)} > t]
\end{align}


\begin{theorem}
\begin{align}
\pr [T(\ell) > t, Y(\ell) > y]
= \iint\limits_{x \le \ell, t' \in [0,t)} \overline \nu(y, t - t') U(dx, dt')
\end{align}
\end{theorem}


\section{Semi-Markov property of Record process}

\section{Point process characterization of records}
\label{sec:records}

%It is self-similar with exponent $\beta$
%\cite{limitCTRW}, non-decreasing, and the (regenerative, random) set 
%$\mathcal R$ of its points of increase is a fractal with dimension $\beta$ 
%\cite{Bertoin04}.
%$E(t)$ is hence a model for time series with intermittent, `bursty'
%behaviour, for the following reasons:
%\begin{itemize}
%\item
%If $t \in \mathcal R$, for any $\epsilon > 0$ the interval
%$(t, t+ \epsilon)$ almost surely contains uncountably many other points of $\mathcal R$ (a ``bursty'' period)
%\item 
%If $t \notin \mathcal R$, then there is $\epsilon > 0$ such that
%$(t, t+ \epsilon)$ contains no other 
%\item [ii)]
%$\mathcal R$ has Lebesgue measure $0$, and hence $E(t)$ is
%constant at any ``randomly'' chosen time $t$. 
%\end{itemize}
%Having only two parameters ($\alpha \in (0,1)$ and a scale parameter)
%the inverse stable subordinator hence models scaling limits of heavy-tailed 
%waiting times parsimoniously.

The book \cite[Chapter 4]{resnick2013extreme} nicely characterizes the structure of records of extreme value processes. Record values and inter-record times follow a bivariate Poisson Point Process, whose intensity measure depends on the underlying distribution of event magnitudes. We generalize these results for max-renewal processes with regularly varying waiting times with infinite mean. 

A \textit{record time} $L$ for a CTRM $V(t)$ is defined by 
\begin{align*}
V(L) > V(t), \quad t < L.
\end{align*}
Paths of CTRMs are piecewise constant, non-decreasing and right-continuous, hence the above is well-defined and the $L$'s form an increasing sequence $\{L_n\}$. The \textit{record values} are then defined as $V(L_n)$. Clearly, the $L_n$ lie in the set $\mathcal R$ of renewal times, i.e.\ $L_n = W_1 + \ldots + W_{\tau(n)}$ for some integer $\tau(n)$. 

Given a record at $L_n$, the next record time $L_{n+1}$ occurs with the first event magnitude $J_k, k \ge \tau(n)$, which is larger than $V(L_n)$. As the $J_k$ are i.i.d., $\tau(n+1) - \tau(n)$ must be geometrically distributed, with parameter $p = 1 - F_J(V(L_n))$, and hence 
\begin{align} \label{eq:geometric-sum}
L_{n+1} - L_n \stackrel{d}{=} \sum_{k=1}^{N(p)} W_k
\end{align}
where $N(p) \sim {\rm Geom}(p)$, independent of the $W_k$. 

The record values $V(L_n)$ form a Markov chain (see e.g.\ \cite{resnick2013extreme}), and moreover we may characterize the record structure of CTRMs as follows: 

\begin{proposition}
\begin{enumerate}
\item
$\{V(L_n), n \ge 1\}$ is a Markov chain with stationary transition probabilities satisfying
\begin{align*}
\Pi(x, (y,\infty)) = 
\begin{cases}
(1-F(y)) / (1-F(x)), & y > x
\\
1, & y \le x
\end{cases}
\end{align*}
\item
$\{V(L_n), n \ge 1\}$ are the points of a Poisson random measure on $(x_l, x_0)$ with intensity measure
\begin{align*}
R(a,b] = R(b) - R(a)
\end{align*}
where $R(t) = -\log(1-F(t))$. 
\item
If $F_J$ is continuous, $\{V(L_n), L_{n+1} - L_n, n \ge 1\}$ are the points of a bivariate Poisson random measure on
$(x_l, x_0) \times (0,\infty)$ with intensity measure
\begin{align*}
\mu^*(dx, dy) = R(dx) F_W^{*N(1-F_J(x))}(dy),
\end{align*}
where $F_W^{*N(1-F_J(x))}(dy)$ is the convolution of the measure $F_W(dy)$ with itself, taken an independent geometric number of times, with success probability $p = 1-F_J(x)$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
Parts 1 \& 2 are proven in 
\cite[Proposition 4.1 (i) \& (iii)]{resnick2013extreme}.
Part 3 follows from \cite[Proposition 3.8]{resnick2013extreme}, 
applied to the transition function $K(x,dy)$ corresponding to the law \eqref{eq:geometric-sum} of $L_{n+1} - L_n = y$, conditional on $V(L_n) = x$. 
\end{proof}
